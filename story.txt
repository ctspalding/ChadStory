Once upon a time, there was a boy named Chad Spalding. He lived in Glenview, IL his entire life. In 2017, he began his college career at UW-Madison studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The rest is to be continued...

After college, Chad became a very successful engineer at Google. With his steady cash flow, Chad was able to upgrade from his house in Glenview to a beautiful mansion on Lake Michigan in Chicago.

On what seemed to be a beautiful Sunday afternoon, Chad decided to go ice fishing and admire the scenery on the frozen lake. While enjoying his morning cup o' joe however, he suddenly heard a loud rumbling...

One day, Chad looked up and saw a giant wave approaching the city. He was able to warn all of the poeple in time and everyone was able to get away from the deadly wave and move to higher ground.

Cheers roared across the land. "You're our savior Chad!" "We love you Chad!" The mayor gave Chad the key to the city, along with 1 billion dollars. He dontated half of it to charity and invested the remaining 500 million in bitcoin, immediately losing it all to the volatile e-currency market.
